*Question 1*

Subject:  Bad design  

Hello,  
  
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.  
   
Thanks,  
Marissa

Hello Marissa,

thank you for sharing your feedback about the new dashboard design. 
I am sorry that our redesign has made your flow more complicated and I completely understand your frustration. Rest assured, that your feedback is valuable and helps us make our product better. 
Would you have time to show me your iterating, so that I have more context, and we can find a solution together?
Let me know about your availability and looking forward to speaking to you soon,

*Question 2*:   
  
From: carrie@coffee.com  
Subject: URGENT ISSUE WITH PRODUCTION!!!!  
  
Since today 9:15am we have been seeing a lot of errors on our website. Multiple users have reported that they were unable to publish their feedbacks and that an alert box with "Record is too big, please contact enterprise@algolia.com".  
  
Our website is an imdb like website where users can post reviews of coffee shops online. Along with that we enrich every record with a lot of metadata that is not for search. I am already a paying customer of your service, what else do you need to make your search work?  
  
Please advise on how to fix this. Thanks.

Hello Carrie,

Thank you for reaching out. I understand your frustration and the urgency of this matter. 
The error message you have provided indicates that your individual records might have grown too large. To address this, you might want to remove metadata that isn't pertinent to the search from your records.
Here is a [guide](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/how-to/reducing-object-size/) that might help.
If this doesn't help, let's have a call, so that we can sort it out.

Can you fix it please?

Hello Marc,

Thank you for reaching out. Looking at the image you provided, it seems to me that you have a problem with "searchkit". 
I would be happy to help, but SearchKit isn't a part of Algolia and belongs to ElasticSearch. 
If you'd like, we can have a call where we discuss how Algolia's tooling can improve your website.
I'm sorry I couldn't be more help.
